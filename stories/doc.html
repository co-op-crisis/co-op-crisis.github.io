      <p>Just like a teacher tells their student– whether that teacher is an academic educator, or a sports coach, or any kind of instructor– we had trust in, enjoyment with, and lessons to learn from the journeyed process of moving toward the final result of our project! The time I heard the concept of "enjoy the process," I heard it precedently paired with "don't focus on the end result more than you [enjoy the process]," and that made me realize the importance of making the most of the steps we took in planning, research, adapting, and creating. Alex shared that sentiment with Josh on the first day of classes way back in January, during our discussion exercise to turn and talk with our neighbors about what research-creation meant to us. According to our class' first text, "(Gauntlett (2021, n.p.) states that “Practice-based research is work where, in order to explore their research question, the researcher needs to make things as part of the process" (DuBois, 3) In doing just that throughout this semester, we have in turn also strengthened the quality of our final project by focusing on the process as near-infinitely as we did the final result.</p>
      <p>The initial idea to research and produce a project on co-ops is credited to Nikolaj, who brought up the thought to the rest of our group, Alex and Josh, during our initial brainstorm session in class, when everyone was spitballing draft ideas for research topics. Nikolaj found the idea of co-ops interesting, and as Alex and Josh found the proposition fascinating, all three of us agreed that we would move forward with that subject. During this stage of our creative process, we all found exceptional importance in constructive support of each others' ideas. We would discuss ways to improve even further upon what one teammate had just suggested, and learned the values of communication, coordination, and creativity. Josh took the initiative with researching the history of co-ops, organizing our shared findings in chronological order, and setting up the interactive KnightLab timeline in which everything is presented. Alex conceptualized the vision of having a virtual tower comprising numerous architectural designs to serve as our main interactive visual, and conducted the predominant research into recent co-op experiences around the island borough of Manhattan, such as how current co-op applicants have been rejected without cause, and the details of 'horror story' rejections handed down by the boards of these co-ops, as similarly referenced by our interview subject. Nikolaj spearheaded the construction of the interactive tower, from its visual design to behind-the-scenes programming, and building the structure from literal scratch by writing out the basic code (from scratch!) in JavaScript(!), and using the program to animate it further. Josh sent out the bulk of the initial emails to authors and professors of different colleges on the topic, while Alex attempted to reach out to resources in Chinatown to understand how the development of the co-op scene in Lower Manhattan is affected by the actions of co-op members.</p>
      <p>Later in development, Josh also led the creation of the graphs through LookerStudio, and Nikolaj handled the 'maintenance' of the near-completed visual tower, while Alex researched, sniffed out, hunted down, and literally tracked interview sources. He conducted, recorded, and edited an interview with a co-op owner whom he happened to strike up a conversation with while waiting at a bus stop. Alex is still hoping to snag an opportunity to interview a co-op board member for their perspective (hopefully on or before May 7, but he'll still press on even after that date passes, at least for our group's own edification). This experience with gathering interviews drove home the point of 'casting a wider net as early as possible to catch the most fish' by reaching out to as many sources as possible, as soon as possible, in order to obtain the highest number of responses statistically possible. Josh and Alex also worked together to write summary blurbs for their sourced timeline and co-op 'horror story' research articles, which Nikolaj inputted into the timeline and tower. Josh additionally created the graphs based on datasets collected by Alex, who scoured a database source by Josh. Alex also reviewed and assisted with editing the graphs. Every member of the group contributed to every aspect of the project in some way throughout the process toward its final iteration, whether directly taking lead on a section and directing the other two to assist in various details, constructively suggesting feedback to tweak some details for further future improvement, or brainstorming fresh ideas to newly implement. We also played to our strengths, deciding early on that we would exercise our prior and adaptive talents in various sectors to produce the best work any team could, much like how professional teams have their investigative journalists, data experts, and digital programmers all doing primarily different tasks– sometimes filling in with a helping hand for someone else for a minute– but all collaboratively producing, contributing and learning toward a common goal project together.</p>
      <p>We certainly faced our share of challenges, obstacles, and dead-end roadblocks, but we importantly overcame them as a team, and with each other's all-crucial assistance. Our main issue was ascertaining who exactly we wanted to interview, and when we had finally figured out our panel of potential interviewees, we were initially unsuccessful in gathering perspectives other than that of a co-op resident (who was first on our list). We likely had a subconscious knowledge that there are advocacy groups out there for… everything, but never considered that there would be ones specifically dedicated to improving co-op experiences, or push back against gentrifying high-rise co-op development, or even work to give applicants fair opportunities when applying to or living in co-ops. After discussing our plans together again, we decided to broaden our search before narrowing down our search criteria, and that brought us to more groups (besides the Housing Data Coalition), including Housing Justice For All, Justice For Our Neighbors, CAAAV Chinatown and CAAAV Flushing, East Harlem/El Barrio Community Trust, and the Urban Homesteading Assistance Board. Alex personally phoned them numerous times, then sent multiple emails across several days to various addresses listed on the websites, and finally paid each a visit in person to no avail. When it came to phone calls, the answering 'staff' at a certain place hadn't informed him that their 'staff wasn't equipped to handle press matters,' or was 'uncomfortable with providing comments after being taken advantage of by media organizations'– amongst the strangest responses you can expect from a meant-to-be-outgoing outreach collective. If Alex wasn't able to reach a live person who picked up any of the multiple phone numbers per group that he called (many of which he wasn't), and emails went unanswered (all of which did), he journeyed to the listed addresses of each office across Queens, Manhattan and Brooklyn. All were closed during their posted 'times of operation,' and were reportedly vacant for days according to neighboring business owners and passersby. To solve this conundrum of a gaping hole in our interviews, Alex asked extra questions of his co-op resident interviewee, whom he met while waiting for a bus while en route from one Upper West Side advocacy group's alleged location to another. He extended their conversation with multiple followup questions, and asked ones that he would've saved for other interviewees. (We highly recommend that you view times 21:00; 25:00; 27:10; 28:30; and 31:00 for the interviewee's views on the co-op experience, board transparency or lack thereof, and suggestions for how whomever can improve.) We also supplemented our reduction in planned interviews with extra co-op 'horror stories' researched from online, as well as the historical background that assists the viewer in learning, knowing, and understanding more about how co-ops came to be, and work to this day. Our group also faced difficulties, in unexpected irony, when deciding what to place in the final version of our tower. Out of all aspects of the project, this was the area that underwent the most conceptual change. Our original imagination envisioned a larger tower that would connect to a map of Manhattan off to its side. The viewer would click a point on the map, and the tower would automatically scroll up or down to a part of the tower representative of the architecture commonly seen in the selected region. After having collected fewer interviews than originally anticipated, and restructuring the manner in which we presented our datasets through our graphs, we needed to determine what the tower would display now. We agreed on placing the co-op stories on the bottom level of the tower, the graphs in its middle section, and the link to the video recording of our interview located on its upper third.</p>
      <p>Nikolaj: Brainstormed co-op topic idea for the entire project; built website, designed tower and subpages from scratch by coding through JavaScript; inputted Josh and Alex's additional writings into timeline</p>
      <p>Josh: Led research on co-op histories through archival research, led timeline creation and data input through KnightLab, led bar graphs creation with LookerStudio and Google Sheets; researched co-op datasets; wrote miscellaneous description texts</p>
      <p>Alex: Researched and selected a dozen potential interview sources; conducted and edited interview with co-op owner; researched co-op datasets, conceptualized tower; wrote miscellaneous description texts; directed type of, assisted on, and edited graphs on LookerStudio and Google Sheets; progress report and final presentation writeups</p>
