      <h2>Hudson Yards / Chelsea</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>The article dives right into the issue of discrimination within exclusive neighborhoods and private clubs across the United States. It examines how certain communities, particularly in affluent areas, use various tactics to maintain exclusivity, such as restrictive membership policies and social norms that discourage diversity. These practices create racial and socioeconomic segregation, despite efforts to promote inclusivity. The article calls attention to the persistence of discrimination in these spaces and suggests that addressing this issue requires broader societal changes and a commitment to equity and diversity.</p>
      <p>This piece also details several stories of rejection faced by potential co-op buyers, who were denied application for undisclosed reasons, but are all members of minority and/or the LGBTQ communities. One particular instance discusses a co-op in the Hudson Yards/Chelsea area, while the others list other buildings that have experienced stories of possible discrimination by boards against prospective buyers.</p>
