      <h3>Top Dozen Reasons for Co-op Board Rejections</h3>
      <h2>4. Pied-a-Terre</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>Some boards are entirely amenable to having pied-a-terres. Others make decisions on a case-by-case basis. Still others do not allow them at all. If one is looking for a pied-a-terre, make sure that the broker has a clear understanding of the rules of prospective buildings.</p>
      <p>Even if a building will consider the sale of an apartment as a pied-a-terre, the board may reject a part-time tenant who they feel might be spending too little time in the apartment. In such cases, the board may be concerned that the apartment could potentially be used as a hotel for friends and family. I know of a couple who attempted to purchase a small one-bedroom pied-a-terre; but because the couple had three teenage children, the board worried that the apartment was too small for a family of that size, and the children might use it for parties in their parents' absence. If the couple had been represented by a knowledgeable broker, they would not have had to waste time applying to a building that would ultimately reject them.</p>
