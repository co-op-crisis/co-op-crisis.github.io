      <h3>Top Dozen Reasons for Co-op Board Rejections</h3>
      <h2>1. Financials</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>A prospective buyer needs sufficient assets following a closing. Boards focus on the amount of liquid assets one has, and many of the premier buildings require one to have two to four times the value of the purchased apartment after closing. Other building boards may insist that one have two to three years of maintenance and mortgage payments in the bank. And, again, that should be the amount after all closing costs have been paid. A knowledgeable broker will not only be aware of each building's requirements, but will also keep abreast of those changing variables, for when new boards are elected every year, they often change the criteria for new buyers.</p>
      <p>If a buyer's income is too low, that buyer may be rejected. The rule of thumb is that co-op boards generally want a buyer to be able to devote 25 percent of one's earnings to the payment of mortgage and maintenance. If those payments for one or more properties exceed more than 25 percent of one's gross annual income, one may very well be turned down.</p>
