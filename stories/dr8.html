      <h3>Top Dozen Reasons for Co-op Board Rejections</h3>
      <h2>8. Failure to Fulfill Additional Requirements</h2>
      <hr />
      <p>Even after receiving a comprehensive board package from a purchaser, a board may require additional documentation for clarification or a preconditioned escrow deposit, or a change in one's mortgage product, prior to even granting an interview. If the buyer is unable or unwilling to accede to the supplementary demands, then the board will likely reject that buyer.</p>
      <p>A fairly common requirement by boards is asking for one to three years of maintenance in escrow. If a board feels that a prospective buyer does not have sufficiently strong financials, the board may decide to approve a purchase, but only if the buyer agrees to the board's demand to put maintenance into an escrow account. After a tenant has a history of meeting financial responsibilities, the escrow account will be dissolved and the funds returned. If a purchaser does not agree to the maintenance escrow, that individual will be rejected.</p>
      <p>Another example includes a purchaser who is unable to provide additional verification of projected income, which sometimes occurs when the buyer is self-employed. It may also occur when a buyer is simply unwilling to provide the requisite documentation for every asset. In both cases, a board may reject a buyer's application.</p>
